//What's a calculator? Maybe something that "counts" some numbers. But, aren't everything made of numbers?       //
//Even "Hi!" is actually "72 73 33", thus becoming a part of the ever growing number system!                     //
//                                                                                                               //
//This simple_calculator is a tool of mathematical destiny which not only adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides//
//(without conquering ofcourse) numbers, but actually even does factorials (though it plays with them a little   //
//before doing so!) staring directly at their eyes, it is sure to return a value before the stock piles!         //
